Typeface:
Primary Typeface
Tatami has two typefaces:
Darker Grotesque & Open Sans: they work well as font pairs.
Darker Grotesque is a contemporary grotesque typeface designed by Gabriel Lam, inspired by the post-modern and brutalism typographic trends.
It should be used for header texts and
sub-header texts only.
